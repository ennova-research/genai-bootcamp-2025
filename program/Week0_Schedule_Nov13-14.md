## **Day 1 – Thursday, November 13**  
**Theme:** *Introduction to the Bootcamp & The AI Revolution*

| Time | Type | Topic | Description / Learning Activities |
|------|------|--------|----------------------------------|
| **09:30–10:30** | Theoretical | **Welcome & Orientation: The AI Revolution** | Overview of bootcamp goals, logistics, and expectations. Exploration of the AI revolution — from symbolic AI to deep learning to generative models. |
| **10:45–11:45** | Practical | **Icebreaker & Setup Lab** | Environment setup: Python, VS Code, GitHub Classroom. Test access to Vertex AI / Watson X sandboxes. |
| **12:00–13:00** | Theoretical | **Generative AI: Concepts & Landscape** | Understand LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal systems, and the generative AI ecosystem. Compare OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and IBM models. |
| **14:30–15:30** | Practical | **Hands-on: First Prompts & Outputs** | Connect to foundational model APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Watson X). Generate text/code/images. Experiment with temperature and max-token settings. |
| **15:45–16:45** | Theoretical | **Architecture of Enterprise AI Applications** | Explore system layers: data, models, orchestration, and UX. Learn roles of APIs, microservices, and deployment pipelines. |
| **17:00–18:00** | Practical | **Mini Lab: Build a Simple AI Microservice** | Use Flask/FastAPI to wrap an LLM API. Deploy locally and test via REST calls. |

## **Day 2 – Friday, November 14**  
**Theme:** *Architecture of Enterprise AI Apps & Foundational Model APIs*

| Time | Type | Topic | Description / Learning Activities |
|------|------|--------|----------------------------------|
| **09:30–10:30** | Theoretical | **AI System Design Patterns** | Study modular architectures for AI: inference pipelines, caching, scalability, and resilience. |
| **10:45–11:45** | Practical | **API Exploration Lab** | Use OpenAI, Gemini, and Watson X SDKs. Send test requests, interpret responses, manage authentication, and rate limits. |
| **12:00–13:00** | Theoretical | **Data Flow in Generative Systems** | Trace data movement from raw input to generated output. Intro to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). |
| **14:30–15:30** | Practical | **Building a Prompt Workflow** | Combine prompt templates, parameters, and output parsing in Python. Store generated results in local JSON. |
| **15:45–16:45** | Theoretical | **Ethics, Bias, and Reliability in Generative AI** | Discuss hallucination, fairness, safety layers, and responsible AI principles. |
| **17:00–18:00** | Practical | **Mini Project: “Ask Me Anything” Bot** | Build a basic chatbot using foundational model APIs, with ethical filters and prompt design best practices. |
