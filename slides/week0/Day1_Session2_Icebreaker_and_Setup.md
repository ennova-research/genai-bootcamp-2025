## 🧩 Environment Setup

We’ll ensure everyone can run code locally:

1. Install **Python 3.12+**. If your system's python is older, use `pyenv` / `pyenv-win` (or `uv` for a full, fast package and project manager).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv bootcamp
   source bootcamp/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
   bootcamp\Scripts\activate    # (Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🧩 Environment Setup

3. Install **git** and clone the repo `https://github.com/ennova-research/genai-bootcamp-2025`
4. Install **VS Code** and the `jupyter` extension

...and let's move on to this session's notebook.
