## 📅 This Week: Preliminaries

- The AI Revolution  
- Enterprise AI Architectures  
- Foundational Model APIs  


---

## 🧩 What Is Artificial Intelligence?

- Simulating human reasoning, learning, and creativity  
- Rule-based → Machine Learning → Deep Learning → Generative AI
<!-- - Generative models: autoregressive (text), diffusion (images) -->


### 🕰️ (A Short, Biased) History of AI

1950s | 1980s | 2010s | 2020s

## 🧱 Generative AI: Core Idea

<!-- > AI models that *create* new content: text, images, code, music, and more. -->
> Train DL models to *re-generate* existing information: hide a part of it, learn to predict what's missing.

- For text: given first $n$ words, predict the word $n+1$.
- For images: given image at resolution $n$ (blurred), predict how it looks like at resolution $n+1$ (not so blurred).

## ⚙️ Enabling Technologies

- Transformers and Attention Mechanisms  
- Diffusion Models  
- Compute Power (GPUs)
- ...The Internet (huge amounts of data!)

---

## 🧠 And the Result?

- Assistants virtually indistinguishable from human experts: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot...
- Professional image and video generation / edition based on natural language input: Dall-E, Midjourney, HeyGen, Sora 2...

> AI as a productivity multiplier: from “tool” to “collaborator”

## 🌍 The AI Revolution Today

- 30+ OpenAI customers have already burned through over _trillions_ of tokens _each_...
- Gartner's saying AI spending will hit around $1.5 trillion this year and over $2 trillion next year.

> Some trillion token companies: Duolingo, OpenRouter, Indeed, Salesforce, CodeRabbit, iSolutionsAI, Outtake, Tiger Analytics, Ramp, Abridge, Sider AI, Warp.dev, Shopify, Notion, WHOOP, HubSpot / Dashworks, JetBrains, Delphi, Decagon, Rox...

## 💡 The Impact of Generative AI

| Domain | Example |
|--------|----------|
| Software Engineering | Code assistants |
| Education | AI tutors |
| Marketing | Content generation |
| ... |  |

Legal? Healthcare? Public administration? You bet...

## ⚠ What can Possibly go Wrong?

- Stargate consortium plans to spend $500 billion to build 10 GW of data center capacity. Within the next two years, AI is expected to consume 12% of all U.S. electricity

> Italy's GDP: ~$2.4 trillion in 2025. Italy's total installed electricity generation capacity was 118.40 GW in 2022.

- Adam Raine, 16, killed himself in April after ChatGPT allegedly helped him explore suicide methods and draft a note. Sewell Setzer III, 14, died in February 2024 after a Character.AI bot told him to "come home" moments before his death. 
- ...
